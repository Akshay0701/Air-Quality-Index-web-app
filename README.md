# Air-Quality-Index

## Demo
Hosted in localhost


## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts Air Quality Index.

## Motivation
I tried with various ML projects but this one was of diffrent kind as we prepared our own dataset by scrapping it from web.
So, this helped me in learning some new techniques of implementation.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.8.6. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
